Management believes these measures help illustrate underlying trends in \\nEPAM’s business and uses the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicate internally and \\nexternally, for managing EPAM’s business and evaluating its performance. Management also believes these measures \\nhelp investors compare EPAM’s operating performance wi th its results in prior periods. EPAM anticipates that it will \\ncontinue to report both GAAP and certain non- GAAP financial measures in its financial results, including non -GAAP \\nresults that exclude stock -based compensation expenses, acquisition- related cos ts including amortization of acquired \\nintangible assets, impairment of assets, expenses associated with EPAM\\'s humanitarian commitment to its professionals \\nin Ukraine, unbilled business continuity resources resulting from Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, cost s associated with the \\ngeographic repositioning of EPAM employees based outside of Ukraine impacted by the war and geopolitical instability in the region, employee separation costs in Russia, certain other one -time charges and benefits, changes in fair value of \\ncontingent consideration, foreign exchange gains and losses, excess tax benefits related to stock -based compensation, \\nand the related effect on income taxes of the pre -tax adjustments. Management also compares revenues on an “organic \\nconstant currency basis excluding the impact of the exit from Russia,” which is also a non -GAAP financial measure. This \\nmeasure excludes the effect of acquisitions by removing revenues from an acquired company in the twelve months after completing an acquisition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by translating the current period revenues into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison and the decision to exit from \\nRussia by removing revenues from customers located in Rus sia in both the current period and prior period of \\ncomparison. Because EPAM’s reported non -GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP , these \\nmeasures are not comparable to GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly described non- GAAP measures reported \\nby other companies within EPAM’s industry. Consequently, EPAM’s non- GAAP financial measures should not be evaluated \\nin isolation or supplant comparable GAAP measures, but rather, should be considered together with the information in \\nEPAM’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with GAAP .  \\n \\n  \\nForward -Looking Statements  \\nThis press release includes estimates and statements which may constitute forward- looking statements made pursuant \\nto the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the accuracy of which are necessarily \\nsubject to risks , uncertainties, and assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate.
