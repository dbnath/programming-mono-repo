Here's a few ideas on how this implementation can be improved:
- Try a different chunking algorithm from langchain or Llama Index.
- Try a more powerful model from hugging face API.
- If you have the time (or money) for installing or loading models, try a few other APIs, transformers library, setups for different LLMs.
