# rag-demo

A bare bones RAG application for educational purposes.

DISCLAIMER: There are several concepts in this repository that can be implemented in much better ways.  The point of this repository is to remove unfamiliar terms and abstractions as much as possible to demonstrate the essential concepts of a RAG application.

You should get acquainted first with RAG and [when to use it and when not to.](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval)
Also, feel free to check out the [BGE family of models](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) a series of API accessible models for many RAG pieces such as embeddings, retrieval, reranking, etc. 

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12 or higher**: Ensure you have Python 3.12 or a later version installed.
- **Poetry**: Install Poetry on your machine for dependency management.
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed in your WSL environment.
- **SSH Key**: Configure your SSH key with your GitHub account if you haven't already.

Using 5 chunks in answer. Answer:

Compiling declarative language model calls into self-improving pipelines
```

## Setup:

This setup works for my WSL installation of Ubuntu with root access.

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:smferro54/rag-workshop-from-scratch.git
cd rag-workshop-from-scratch/
```

2. **Start a pgvector docker container**:

```bash
docker run -p 6432:5432  --name pgvector -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d pgvector/pgvector:pg17
```

Note: The host port for the docker container is 6432 instead of the normal 5432 to avoid port collisions

3. **Setup the database: Ensure you are in the directory where the repository was cloned.**
```bash
psql -h localhost -p 6432 -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE rag_demo;"
psql -h localhost -p 6432 -U postgres rag_demo < schema.sql
```
Note: All psql commands will prompt for a password, which is **"postgres"**.

*Troubleshoot*: 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-client-common
sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

4. **Create the .env file:**
```bash
touch .env
```
Note: You can use the example_env.txt as a reference for the required environment variables.

5. **Export your Hugging Face API Key environment variable:**
```
source .env
```

6. **Install dependencies with Poetry:**
```
poetry install
```
*Troubleshoot*: 
```
sudo apt update
curl -fsSL https://pyenv.run | bash
pyenv install 3.12.0
pyenv local 3.12.0
```

### Running

`poetry run python -m rag_demo`

You can skip the embedding step if you already have a database and want to experiment with different models. 
`poetry run python -m rag_demo --skip-embedding-step`

### Check chunks table first 5 rows
```
psql -h localhost -p 6432 -U postgres rag_demo -c "SELECT * FROM chunks LIMIT 5;"
```
