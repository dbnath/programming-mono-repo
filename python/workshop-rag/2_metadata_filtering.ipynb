    "\n",
    "The first step is to get our data, but this time, we'll be more deliberate about what information we extract. Instead of just grabbing all the text, we'll create custom functions to pull out specific pieces of metadata and the main article content.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll define two functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `custom_metadata_extractor`: This function will parse the HTML to find the page title, description, language, and any associated \"subjects\" or tags. It uses BeautifulSoup to navigate the HTML structure and find the relevant elements.\n",

    "2. `article_extractor`: This function's job is to find the main article content of the page, which is usually contained within an <article> tag.\n",

We’re launching this initiative to understand how AI is reshaping the way we work and surface proposals on how to prepare for this shift. This program will serve as an extension of Anthropic’s Economic Index and its insights on AI usage across the workforce. Our goal for this program is to contribute to the development of new research and potential responses to the impacts of AI on the labor market and global economy. To accomplish this, the Economic Futures Program will focus on three pillars:Research Grants: Providing grants, API credits, and partnerships to enable researchers to investigate AI's effects on labor, productivity, and value creation;Evidence-Based Policy: Creating forums for researchers, policymakers, and\n",
